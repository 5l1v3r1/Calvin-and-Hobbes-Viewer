If you want to install this app before approval by the App Store and have a Mac, you can build and install the app onto your device.

First, make sure you have a developer account with Apple. This is necessary to install the app on your device. You need to [set up a provisioning profile](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/qa/qa1814/_index.html) for you copy of Xcode. 

Then, simply download the zip folder of this repository and open the Xcode project in `/Server`. Connect your iPhone to your computer and select it as the build target in the top left corner of Xcode.
